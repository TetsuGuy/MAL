Instructions:
##################
- go to your Animelist "Plan to watch" / or just your anime - list (page)
- hit CTR+S to save the list as html / or Right Mousbutton -> "Save"
- start AniSort.jar
	- navigate to your html file
	- you will (hopefully) see the file get processed
	- Anisort will finish and return a output.html

- open output.html to see sorted list
- list contains Title + Score and every entry is a clickable link to the MAL page of that Title


Note: please be patient with the process. it is a really
rough program and takes a while to process long lists...

Maybe i will optimize it in the future.

There is a example page for you to sort in the .zip file. 

Update 01: added a progress bar
Update 02: added a proper finishing of the program
Update 03: added a exe Version (also on github)
