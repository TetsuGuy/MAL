Instructions:
##################
- go to your Animelist "Plan to watch"
- hit CTR+S to save the list as html
- start AniSort.jar
	- navigate to your html file
	- you will (hopefully) see the file get processed
	- Anisort will finish and return a output.html

- open output.html to click on sorted list



Note: please be patient with the process. it is a really
rough program and takes a while to process long lists...

Maybe i will optimize it in the future.

There is a example page for you to sort in the .zip file. 

Version2: added a progress bar
